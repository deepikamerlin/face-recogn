Face Recognition:
Understanding Face Recognition: Face recognition is a technology that identifies or verifies a person based on a digital image of their face. It involves capturing features from the face, such as the distance between the eyes, shape of the jaw, or other unique traits, and using these features to identify or distinguish individuals.

Steps in Face Recognition:

Face Detection: The first step is to locate the face within an image. Algorithms like Haar Cascades or deep learning-based methods detect the face and crop it out for further analysis.
Feature Extraction: Important features are extracted from the face image. This is often done using deep learning models (like CNNs) that can identify unique patterns in a face.
Comparison: The extracted features are compared to features in a database of known faces to find a match. This comparison can tell if the face in the image belongs to a person in the database.
Libraries Used:

OpenCV: Commonly used for face detection.
Face Recognition Library: Based on dlib, it simplifies facial feature extraction and comparison.
Deep Learning Libraries: TensorFlow and PyTorch are also used for advanced face recognition models.
